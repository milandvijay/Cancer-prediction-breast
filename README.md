This app predicts using a machine learning model whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on the measurements it receives from your cytosis lab. You can also update the measurements by hand using the sliders in the sidebar. The user can predict the probability of `breast cancer` by different parameters of `Cell Nuclei Measurements` and it shows `meanvalue`, `standard error`and `worst value` of different parameter of `Cell Nuclei Measurements` in radar chart
